# AI Support Reply Assistant

## Project Overview

AI Support Reply Assistant is a complete full-stack AI project for **Multi-Agent AI** at **Beginner** difficulty. It includes a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, sample documents, vector search with ChromaDB support, source citations, timeline logs, structured run storage, Docker files, and tests.

Customer support often involves repetitive tasks like categorizing tickets and drafting replies based on common issues. This project automates these initial steps using a collaborative AI agent team, improving efficiency and response times for support agents. It focuses on handling common, well-documented queries, allowing human agents to focus on complex or unique customer problems.

Difficulty controls project complexity, architecture depth, AI model selection, and how advanced the generated codebase is.

- Architecture depth: minimal backend, simple folder structure, easy README, low-cost/free model
- Selected architecture: Content Writing Team
- Template path: templates/multi-agent-ai/content-writing-team
- Generated stack: FastAPI backend, React UI, local vector fallback, simple tests
- README style: beginner-friendly setup and clear expected output

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy
- AI/RAG: LangChain-ready prompt layer, ChromaDB vector storage, local deterministic fallback model
- Workflow: Agent pipeline with planner, retrieval, tool, reasoning, and final answer steps
- Frontend: React and Vite
- Database: SQLite by default, PostgreSQL through Docker Compose
- Testing: pytest
- Difficulty: Beginner

## Generation Method

This project was generated with a template-based architecture engine. AI is used only for the blueprint, domain customization, sample data, prompts, and documentation. The codebase is produced from tested FastAPI/React/Docker templates rather than raw LLM source output.

## Project Type Satisfaction Map

This generated project satisfies **Multi-Agent AI** through the runtime path below. The implementation is not only a README claim: the files listed after the diagram are generated in the repository and validated before GitHub push.

Runtime proof points:

- `frontend/src/App.jsx` renders the user workspace, starter prompts, answer panel, cited sources, and timeline.
- `backend/app/main.py` exposes `POST /api/ask` and returns the final answer, sources, timeline steps, and project type.
- `backend/app/services/pipeline.py` orchestrates the project-type flow: Researcher Agent, Analyst Agent, Reviewer Agent.
- `backend/app/services/vector_store.py` loads sample documents and retrieves relevant cited context.
- `backend/app/domain.py` contains the generated topic-specific workflow steps, business rules, tools, persona, and starter questions.
- `backend/app/db.py` stores each run so the generated app behaves like a real workflow tool instead of a static prompt demo.
- `backend/tests/test_project_contract.py` validates the API contract and project-type behavior.

Type-specific behavior:

- Flow style: Researcher agent -> analyst agent -> reviewer agent -> final synthesized answer.
- Visible output: final answer, cited sources, timeline steps, and project type.
- Validation gate: pytest, frontend build, Docker Compose config, and Docker build before repository upload.

## Environment Variables

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
USE_CREWAI_RUNTIME=false
PINECONE_API_KEY=
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

The app runs without an OpenAI key by using a deterministic local answer model. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to use LangChain with OpenAI. For CrewAI projects, set `USE_CREWAI_RUNTIME=true` after installing dependencies to run the live CrewAI Agent/Task/Crew workflow; otherwise the app uses a deterministic CrewAI-shaped fallback.

For Pinecone projects, add `PINECONE_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME` to use a live Pinecone index. Without them, the repo still runs using local ChromaDB/local retrieval fallback.

## Installation

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Run With Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Example API Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ask ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"question\": \"What is the refund policy?\"}"
```

## Example User Question

```text
What should I do if a customer asks for a refund without an order id?
```

## Expected Output

The API returns:

- `answer`: a grounded answer generated from retrieved context
- `sources`: cited document chunks with similarity scores
- `steps`: planner, retriever, reasoning, tool-call, and final-answer timeline logs
- `project_type`: `Multi-Agent AI`

## How The RAG/Agent Flow Works

Researcher agent -> analyst agent -> reviewer agent -> final synthesized answer.

## Project Planner Agent Workflow

User -> React Dashboard -> FastAPI -> Project Planner Agent -> Specialist Agents -> Generated Project -> Auto Testing -> GitHub Repository Creation -> Push Code -> Return GitHub URL

- **Architecture Agent**: Define app boundaries, data flow, runtime stack, and integration points. Outputs: Project-ready output.
- **Backend Agent**: Design FastAPI modules, service contracts, validation, and error handling. Outputs: Project-ready output.
- **Frontend Agent**: Design React screens, state flow, controls, and user feedback states. Outputs: Project-ready output.
- **Database Agent**: Design persistence models, sample data, indexes, and audit records. Outputs: Project-ready output.
- **Testing Agent**: Define contract tests, smoke tests, and generated project validation. Outputs: Project-ready output.

## AI-Customized Domain Workflow

- 1: User creates a new support ticket via the frontend (or it's ingested by the backend).
- 2: Backend API receives the new ticket and stores it in the database with status 'New'.
- 3: Backend triggers the 'TicketCategorizer' agent with the new ticket's description.
- 4: TicketCategorizer agent analyzes the description and assigns a predefined category (e.g., 'Billing', 'Technical Issue', 'Feature Request').
- 5: The assigned category is saved back to the ticket in the database, and the ticket status updates to 'Categorized'.
- 6: Backend triggers the 'ReplyGenerator' agent with the ticket description and the newly assigned category.
- 7: ReplyGenerator agent uses the 'KnowledgeBaseSearch' tool to find relevant articles based on the ticket description and category.
- 8: ReplyGenerator agent drafts a reply incorporating information from the retrieved knowledge base articles, maintaining a helpful and professional tone.

## Business Rules

- All new tickets must be categorized within 5 minutes of creation.
- A reply draft must be generated for all categorized tickets.
- Reply drafts should always include a polite closing and suggest next steps if applicable.
- Knowledge base articles are the primary source of factual information for replies; agents should not 'hallucinate' solutions.
- The system should flag tickets as 'Complex' if agents cannot find relevant KB articles or categorize with high confidence.
- Maximum length for generated replies should be 300 words to keep them concise.

1. The backend loads sample documents from `backend/app/data/sample_docs`.
2. Documents are split into chunks.
3. Chunks are embedded and stored in ChromaDB when available, with a local fallback for development.
4. User questions are matched against relevant chunks.
5. Agent-specific steps run: planner, retriever, tool call, reasoning, reviewer, or graph nodes.
6. The final answer is returned with source citations and a timeline.

## Testing

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

## Validation Gates Before GitHub Push

The SaaS validates generated projects before creating and pushing the GitHub repository:
